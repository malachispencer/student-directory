# Student Directory

The student directory script allows you to manage lists of students.

## How to use

```shell
ruby app.rb
```

## Features

1. Create a new directory: A directory is a list of students stored in a CSV file. CSV files created from the app are saved in the
   application root's 'directories' folder, which is created the first time you run the application.

2. Show an existing directory: Print students of the selected directory in the terminal.

3. Update a directory: You can rename a directory (i.e. filename), add students to a directory and delete students from a directory.

4. Delete a directory: You can delete a directory using the app, which will delete the file from the directories folder.
